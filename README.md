# CICD-Jenkins

This repository contains the configuration files necessary for setting up a Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipeline using Jenkins and Docker. The primary focus is on automating the build and deployment process for a Java application.

## Purpose

This repository provides the configuration to automate the build and deployment of a Java application using Jenkins and Docker. It streamlines the development workflow by:

* Automating the build process with Maven.
* Creating a Docker image for easy deployment.
* Utilizing Jenkins for continuous integration and delivery.

## Setup and Usage

1.  **Jenkins Setup:**
    * Ensure you have a Jenkins server running.
    * Install the necessary Jenkins plugins (e.g., Docker, Maven Integration).
    * Create a new Pipeline job in Jenkins.
    * Configure the Pipeline job to use the `Jenkinsfile` from this repository.
    * Configure any necessary credentials on jenkins for docker hub or any external repository.

2.  **Maven Configuration (`settings.xml`):**
    * The `settings.xml` file is configured to handle Maven dependencies and repository settings.
    * Make sure that the paths to any local repositories or credentials within the settings.xml are adjusted to match your environment.

3.  **Docker Configuration (`Dockerfile`):**
    * The `Dockerfile` builds a Docker image of the Java application.
    * Ensure that the Docker environment is configured correctly on the Jenkins server.
    * If you are planning on pushing the docker image to a remote registry, make sure to adjust the docker push commands within the Jenkinsfile, and add the necessary credentials to jenkins.

4.  **Jenkins Pipeline (`Jenkinsfile`):**
    * The `Jenkinsfile` defines the CI/CD pipeline stages.
    * It includes stages for checking out the code, building with Maven, creating a Docker image, and potentially deploying it.
    * Review the stages and adjust them to fit your specific deployment requirements.

## Notes

* This repository primarily focuses on the CI/CD pipeline setup. The `src/` directory contains the original Java source code provided for context.
* Adjust the `Jenkinsfile`, `settings.xml` and `Dockerfile` to match your specific environment and application requirements.
* Ensure that docker is installed on the jenkins server, and that the jenkins user has permissions to run docker commands.
